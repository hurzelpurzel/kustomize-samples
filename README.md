# Transforme 
As the name indicates, transformers are something that transforms one config into another. Using Transformers, we can transform our base Kubernetes YAML configs. Kustomize has several built-in transformers. Let’s see some common transformers:

  *  commonLabel – It adds a label to all Kubernetes resources
  *  namePrefix – It adds a common prefix to all resource    names
  *  nameSuffix – It adds a common suffix to all resource    names
  *  Namespace – It adds a common namespace to all resources
  *    commonAnnotations – It adds an annotation to all resources
